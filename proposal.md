**Paddle Master Proposal**

This is my proposal for my game **Paddle Master** It will demonstrate a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript.



# Overview

My game is called **Paddle Master**, and is based on the 1970s arcade classic "Pong" by Atari. The object of the game is to use your paddle to keep the ball in play or hit the ball past your oppent to score points.

# Gameplay

    The game is fairly easy to play. The player controls the paddle using the arrow keys to move up and down the y axis.
    The goal of the game is to serve the ball to the openent and try to get it past them. For every hit past oppenent you are awarded 1 point. First to score 5 points wins the game


# Basic Features

The basic features of the game include:
    *`Ability to move up and down`*
    *`Scoreboard`*
    *`New game starts after the winner reaches 5`*
    *`Interactive UI`*


# Goals

The origianl version will just have a black background with white paddles, balls and border.

I have some goals for the game visually. Ideally i would like to make the paddles made to look like hockey sticks and make the ball into a puck of some sort.
