# Paddle Master Proposal

This is my proposal for my game **F1 Trivia** It will demonstrate a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript.



# Overview

My game is called **F1 Trivia**, which is based off the popular motorsport F1

# Gameplay

The game is fairly easy to play and will depend of the users knowledge of the sport. The game will consist of 8 questions and a score of at least 50% will be needed to win.


# Basic Features
*`Ability to choose an answer`*
*`Score counter`*
*`New game can be chosen at the end`*
*`Final results`*


# Goals

I would like to make the game process more automated so some of the buttons wont be needed.

I would also like to add more difficulties that will include more questions.
