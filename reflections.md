1. For HTML i now understand why the id's and classes are so important. CSS i got a little better with tagging specific things, i also got better at sizing background images. I have been having the hardest time with Javascript but this project allowed me to try things and actually understand how stuff works, i feel a lot better with how functions and loops works i cant say i could go out and write one with a ton of logic. I still think i need practice with it along with canvas after seeing how everyone used it and i dont really have an understanding of it, but just something to work torwards.

2. Javascript as a whole, logic, canvas, maybe even going over DOM manipulation a little bit.
